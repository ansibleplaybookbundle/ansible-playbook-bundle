# APB tooling

> NOTE: Project is still a WIP and rapidly changing.

`apb` is a tool for helping APB authors create, build, and publish
their APBs to container registries. It enforces best practices and takes
care of the details so they should be easy to deploy.

## Commands

### Init

`apb init` is a helper that will generate a skeleton APB directory with
an `apb.yml`, a `Dockerfile`, a `roles` directory, and a `playbooks` directory. 
`apb init` requires a name to be passed as an argument which will be used as the 
APB name.

#### Options:
```
`--org ORGANIZATION` specifies an organization name for the APB image on the `Dockerfile`.
`--async ASYNC_OPTION` specifies the asynchronous operation of the APB. Defaults to `optional`
         valid options are: ['required', 'optional', 'unsupported']
`--bindable` specifies if the APB will be bindable by default. Defaults to `False`.
`--param PARAM_STRING`, `-p PARAM_STRING` Specifies which parameters to include by default in `apb.yml`.
    `PARAM_STRING` contains four options to specify for a parameter separated by a comma. `name`, `type`, `description`, `default`.
    Ex. `apb init my_apb -p name=sample_name,default=foo,type=string,description="sample description"`
`--force` forces reinitialization of project directory if it already exists
`--skip-provision` will skip generation of provision playbook and role
`--skip-deprovision` will skip generation of deprovision playbook and role
`--skip-bind` will skip generation of bind playbook and role
`--skip-unbind` will skip generation of unbind playbook and role
`--skip-roles` will skip generation of any roles
```

### Prepare

`apb prepare` is a helper that will update the `Dockerfile` with
your `apb.yml` file encoded as a base64 label. This allows the spec
to be accessible to clients via registry APIs without the necessity of downloading
full images. For example, the [Ansible Service Broker](https://www.github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker)
will use this data to build an inventory of available APBs in a given
registry and expose them to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.



By default, the CWD is used, but it will accept a directory location via
`--project=$LOCATION` as well.

Prepare also expects a specfile, `apb.yml`, to exist at the project root.
[More on specfiles and expected contents.](https://github.com/fusor/ansible-playbook-bundle/blob/master/docs/design.md).

Following `apb prepare`, you should have a Dockerfile and a correctly
ID'd specfile. Build and publish this container to your preferred registry.

### Build

`apb build` is a helper which will build your APB in the current directory.
`build` simply expects a Dockerfile in the proper format to be in the current
working directory. `build` takes one optional argument which is the tag which 
will be used to tag the built APB Docker image.

#### Options
```
`--tag TAG` specifies a tag to use for building the APB image
```

### Push

`apb push` is a helper which will push your APB spec in the current directory to
an Ansible Service Broker. `push` takes one argument which is the route or IP+Port
combination of the Ansible Service Broker.
